<h2>Focus</h2>
<p>The focus directive helps you focus any HTML element on demand (on event/action).</p>
<p>Put '<b>bk-focus="false"</b>' as an attribute on the element that you want and when you want it to receive
    focus, change its value to '<b>true</b>'.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>
<code-block>
    <bk-button label="Default" ng-click="focusInput = true"></bk-button>
    <bk-input type="text" bk-focus="{{focusInput}}"></bk-input>
</code-block>
