# BlimpKit

BlimpKit is an AngularJS directive/component UI library based on the <a href="https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/">fundamental-styles</a> CSS library.

While it mostly follows the fundamental style guides, it deviates in some places and some of the widgets are modified and/or removed, therefore it should not be viewed as an official implementation.

BlimpKit is its own library and contains some extra components that are unique to it.
