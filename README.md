# BlimpKit

BlimpKit is an AngularJS directive/component UI library based on the <a href="https://sap.github.io/fundamental-styles/">fundamental-styles</a> CSS library.

While it mostly follows the fundamental style guides, it deviates in some places and some of the widgets are modified and/or removed, therefore it should not be viewed as an official implementation.

BlimpKit is its own library and contains some extra components that are unique to it.

## Themes

Officially, there are two themes available.

* BlimpKit - This is the default theme and it has light, dark and auto modes.
* Classic - SAP Quartz-based theme. The differences are minimal.
